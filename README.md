# ReliabilityCalc
C++ realiability calculation program, which can be used to calculate the lifetime of an electronics circuit

The parts, which are used are modelled from various sources. One source can be the datasheets, but also a "private" database with stored reliability data can be used.

## Requirements
This program uses an SQLite3 to manage the reliability sources. Hence the sqlite3 headers are needed
